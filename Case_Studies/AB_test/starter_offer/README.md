# A/B Test: Starter Offers in Mobile Game Store

This case study focuses on evaluating the impact of changes made to the starter offers in a mobile game store. An A/B test was conducted to compare the performance of the modified starter offer against the original offer.

## Overview

The primary objective of this A/B test is to determine the effect of offering a starter pack at a fivefold lower price with half the content. The test aims to understand if this change can drive more purchases and improve overall revenue.

## Test Groups

- **Control Group:** Users who receive the original starter offer.
- **Test Group:** Users who receive the modified starter offer, which is priced five times lower and contains half the content of the original offer.

## Dataset

The dataset for this test is available in the [starter_offer_ab_dataset.csv](./starter_offer_ab_dataset.csv) file. It contains transactional data, user information, and details about the starter offers purchased.

## Analysis and Conclusions

The analysis and conclusions derived from the A/B test can be found in the [AB_test_starter_offer.ipynb](./AB_test_starter_offer.ipynb) Jupyter notebook. This notebook provides a step-by-step breakdown of the analysis process, the metrics used for evaluation, and the final conclusions drawn from the test results. I suggest attempting the problem before viewing the Jupyter Notebook.
